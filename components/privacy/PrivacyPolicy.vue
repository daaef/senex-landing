              pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents
              otherwise).

            <p>

            </p>
            <h4>HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
              Our systems are designed with your security and privacy in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              We protect your personal information by maintaining physical,
              electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with the
              applicable laws and regulations.For example, we use computer
              safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce
              physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we
              authorise access to personal information only for those employees
              who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. Full credit
              card data is securely transferred and hosted off-site by a payment
              vendor in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security
              Standards (PCI DSS). This Information is not accessible to
              SenexPay or SenexPay staff.
            </p>
            <p>
              While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorised
              acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur. Please
              recognise that you play a vital role in protecting your own
              personal information. When Registering with our Services, it is
              important to choose a password of sufficient length and
              complexity, to not reveal this password to any third-parties, and
              to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorised
              access to or use of your account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or
              confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from
              us by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or
              SMS,since we have no way of protecting that information once it
              leaves and until it reaches us. If you have reason to believe that
              your data is no longer secure, please contact us immediately
            </p>
            <h4>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
              You can access your information, including your name, address,
              payment options, profile information, and transaction history in
              the "Your Account" section of the website. You are also entitled
              to review, correct, or amend your personal information, or to
              delete where it is inaccurate. You may do this at any time by
              contacting us. If you close your SenexPay Account, we will mark
              your account in our database as "Closed," but will keep your
              account information in our database for a period of time described
              above. This is necessary inorder to deter fraud, by ensuring that
              persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid
              detection simply by closing their account and opening a new
              account.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if you close your account, your personal information will
              not be used by us for any other purpose, or shared with third
              parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law
              enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this
              Privacy Policy.
            </p>

              hold about you under European data protection legislation, and to
              some related information. You can also require any inaccurate
              personal information to be corrected or deleted.
            </p>

              information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for
              which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying
              any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations or to resolve
              disputes. While Retention requirements vary by jurisdiction,
              information about our typical retention periods for different
              aspects of your personal information are described below.

              Content that you post on our website such as support desk
              comments, photographs, videos, blog posts, and other content may
              be kept indefinitely after you close your account for audit and
              crime prevention purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recording of our telephone calls with you may be kept for a period
              of up to six years. Information collected via technical means such
              as cookies, web page counters and other analytics tools is kept
              for a period of up to one year from expiry of the cookie.
            </p>
            <h4>CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
              We do not knowingly request to collect personal information from a
              person under the age of 18. If a user submitting personal
              information is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age,
              SenexPay will require the user to close his or her account and
              will not allow the user to continue transacting digital currencies
              using our platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will also take steps to delete the information as soon as
              possible. Please notify us if you know of any individuals under
              the age of 18 using our Services so we can take action to prevent
              access to our Services.
            </p>
            <h4>GLOBAL COMPANY</h4>
            <p>

              processed outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside, and the
              laws of those countries may differ from the laws applicable in
              your own country. For example, data collected in the European
              Economic Area (EEA) may be transferred to, stored and processed at
              a destination(s) outside of the EEA. Any processing of such data
              will be undertaken by our staff, or the staff of our third-party
              service providers, whose roles will include verifying your
              identity, processing payment details, and providing customer
              support.

              personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing or processing of
