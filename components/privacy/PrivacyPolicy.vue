            </p>
            <p>
              We protect your personal information by maintaining physical,
              electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with the
              applicable laws and regulations.For example, we use computer
              safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce
              physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we
              authorise access to personal information only for those employees
              who require it to fulfil their job responsibilities. Full credit
              card data is securely transferred and hosted off-site by a payment
              vendor in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security
              Standards (PCI DSS). This Information is not accessible to
              SenexPay or SenexPaystaff.

            <p>
              While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorised
              acquisition,or alteration of your data will not occur. Please
              recognise that you play a vital role in protecting your own
              personal information. When Registering with our Services, it is
              important to choose a password of sufficient length and
              complexity, to not reveal this password to any third-parties, and
              to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorised
              access to or use of your account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or
              confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from
              us by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or
              SMS,since we have no way of protecting that information once it
              leaves and until it reaches us. If you have reason to believe that
              your data is no longer secure, please contact us immediately
            </p>
            <h4>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
              You can access your information, including your name, address,

              the "Your Account" section of the website. You are also entitled
              to review, correct, or amend your personal information, or to
              delete where it is inaccurate. You may do this at any time by

              our database as "Closed," but will keep your account information
              in our database for a period of time described above. This is
              necessary inorder to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try
              to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by
              closing their account and opening a new account.
            </p>

              parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law
              enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this
              Privacy Policy.
