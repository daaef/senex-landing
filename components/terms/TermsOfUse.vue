              <span class="u-wt-700">3.1. In General: </span>Your Digital
              Currency Wallet enables you to send Digital Currency to, and
              request, receive, and store Digital Currency from, third parties
              by giving instructions through the Senexpay Site (each such
              transaction is a "Digital Currency Transaction").
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="u-wt-700">3.2. Digital Currency Transactions:</span>
              We will process Digital Currency Transactions in accordance with
              the instructions we receive from you. You should verify all
              transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us. We
              do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or
              other party. Digital Currency Transactions cannot be reversed once
              they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital Currency network.
              Once submitted to a Digital Currency network, a Digital Currency
              Transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending
              sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Currency
              network. A Digital Currency Transaction is not complete while it
              is in a pending state. Digital Currency associated with Digital
              Currency Transactions that are in a pending state will be
              designated accordingly, and will not be included in your Digital
              Currency Wallet balance or be available to conduct Digital
              Currency Transactions. We may charge network fees (minor fees) to
              process a Digital Currency Transaction on your behalf. We will
              calculate the network fee in its discretion, although we will
              always notify you of the network fee at or before the time you
              authorise the Digital Currency Transaction. We may refuse to
              process or cancel any pending Digital Currency Transaction as
              required by law or any court or other authority to which Senexpay
              is subject in any jurisdiction.

            <p>
              <span class="u-wt-700">3.3. Supported Digital Currencies: </span>
              Our Digital Currency Services are available only in connection
              with those digital currencies that Senexpay supports, and this may
              change from time to time. Under no circumstances should you
              attempt to use your Digital Currency Wallet to store, send,
              request, or receive digital currencies in any form that we do not
              support (although we will use reasonable efforts to help you move
              or sell Digital Currency that we no longer support). We assume no
              responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use
              your Digital Currency Wallet for digital currencies that we do not
              support.

              legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may
              purchase or sell to or from a third party (including other users
              of Senexpay Digital Currency Services). We are not responsible for
              ensuring that a third party buyer or a seller you transact with
              will complete the transaction or is authorised to do so. If you
              experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or
              sold to, a third party using Digital Currency transferred using
              the Senexpay Digital Currency Services, or if you have a dispute
              with such third party, you should resolve the dispute directly
              with that third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in
              a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you
              cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party.

              </span>
              We do not own or control the underlying software protocols which
              govern the operation of Digital Currencies supported on our
              platform: generally, the underlying protocols are open source and
              anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. We assume no
              responsibility for the operation of the underlying protocols and
              we are not able to guarantee their functionality, security, or
              availability.
              <span class="u-wt-700"
                >You acknowledge and accept the risk that underlying software
                protocols relating to any Digital Currency you store in your
                Digital Currency Wallet may change.</span
              >
              In particular, the underlying protocols are likely to be subject
              to sudden changes in operating rules ("forks"), and such forks may
              materially affect the value, function, and/or the name of the
              Digital Currency you store in your Digital Currency Wallet. Where
              possible, we may provide you with notices or alerts on forks.
              However, it is your responsibility to make yourself aware of, and
              consider how to deal with, upcoming forks. In the event of a fork,
              there is a risk that we may need to temporarily suspend operations
              in relation to that fork without providing advance notice to you.
              We may, in our reasonable discretion, decline to support either or
              both branches of a fork.
              <span class="u-wt-700"
                >You acknowledge the risks presented by forks and you accept
                that we have no responsibility to assist you to move or sell an

              immediate effect for any reason, including but not limited to
              where: We are, in our reasonable opinion, required to do so by
              applicable law or any court or other authority to which we are
              subject in any jurisdiction; We reasonably suspect you of acting
              in breach of this Agreement; We have concerns that a transaction
              is erroneous or about the security of your Senexpay Account or we
              suspect the Senexpay Services are being used in a fraudulent or
              unauthorised manner; We suspect money laundering, terrorist
              financing, fraud, or any other financial crime; If your credit or
              debit card or any other valid payment method linked to your
              Digital Currency Wallet is declined; Use of your Senexpay Account
              is subject to any pending litigation, investigation, or government

              and / or You take any action that may circumvent our controls such
              as opening multiple SteemX Accounts or abusing promotions which we
              may offer from time to time. We may also refuse to complete a
              transaction you have authorised where there is insufficient
              balance in your Senexpay Account and / or insufficient Digital
              Currency in your Digital Currency Wallet to cover the transaction
              and (where applicable) associated fees at the time that we receive
              notification of the transaction. If we refuse to complete a
              transaction and / or suspend or close your Senexpay Account, or
              terminate your use of Senexpay Services in this way, we will
              (unless it would be unlawful for us to do so) provide you with
              notice of our actions and the reasons for refusal, suspension or
              closure and where appropriate, with the procedure for correcting
              any factual errors that led to the refusal, suspension or closure.
              In the event that we refuse to complete a transaction and / or
              suspend your Senexpay Account we will lift the suspension as soon
              as reasonably practicable once the reasons for refusal and / or
              suspension no longer exist. However, we are under no obligation to
              allow you to reinstate a transaction at the same price or on the
              same terms as the suspended, reversed or cancelled transaction. We
              may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of
              the SteemX Services and/or deactivate or cancel your SteemX
              Account, without reason by giving you two months notice. You
              acknowledge that our decision to take certain actions, including
              limiting access to, suspending, or closing your SteemX Account,
              may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our
              risk management and security protocols. You agree that we are
              under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management
              and security procedures to you. On termination of this Agreement,
              unless prohibited by applicable law or by any court or other order
              to which Senexpay is subject in any jurisdiction, you may:
