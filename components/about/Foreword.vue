              At SenexPay, we believe equality in society is never complete
              without financial equality. We are seeking to eliminate the
              disenfranchisement of Africans in the global economy by focusing
              on solving the problems associated with cryptocurrency access by
              the average African. We are simplifying the way crypto is accessed
              by everyone; from the Crypto-geek in the city to Grandma in the
              village. We at SenexPay, believe everyone should have easy access
              to Bitcoin and other digital currencies and that belief is
              entrenched in what we do everyday -
